Poseid is the node daemon for the POSE project.

# POSE - Project of Smart Enterprise

P.O.S.E(Project of Smart Enterprise) aimes to be a decentralized platform which enables, incentivizes and modularize enterprise development. Providing the modern enterprise a lower cost and a more effective assembly system.

## Visions

* Extensibility. With the capability of massive data processing and industrial level TPS.
* Unity. An efficient governance mechanism, eliminate forking and dynamic cost adjusting.
* Intercorpability. Be friendly to both developers and enterprises. 

## Key Features

### Extensibility and Integration

Support relational decentralized data storage and processing to serve extensive enterprises both on chain and off chain.

a) A decentralized relational data store

Data store is divided into three parts and stored decentrally: Schema, Relation and Data. Where Schema is used to describe data, Data is used for actual storage, and Relation is used to describe data relations.

b) A relational algebra engine

Support on-chain data relational operations. Including query statements parsing, excution optimizing and logical operations excuting.

### Enterprise Transaction Per Second (TPS) Performance

Implement a lock-free smart contract execution architecture for better performance. Including a new data fragmentation model, an multi-core shared lock-free data access interspace and a concurrent smart contract VM(Virtual Machine).

### Efficiency

Implement a highly efficient voting system, which including two factors: Nomination and Voting. Let users be able to nominate and vote randomly at a specific time frame, for both producers and proposals.

### Technical Scalability

Support a wide variety of language development, including but not limited to C, C++, GO, Java, Javascript, Python, Rust and even newer language such as Kotlin and Swifth. Introduce the smallest and fastest embeddable Javascript engine QuickJS as a new smart contract VM.
